# TicTacToe Machine Learning in .Net (No Python)

I wanted to get practical and experiment with some machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms. So I created a Tic Tac Toe game in the language I'm most comfortable with (C#) and am trying out various ways to train opponents all in .Net

To see the journey or evolution of the game and the trained bots, see the YouTube series:

So far I've got:
- Random Move Bot
- MiniMax Algoritm Bot
- Reinforcement Learning Bot (more specifically Q-Learning)
